## ✨ What is FoundrIQ?

**FoundrIQ AI** is a production-grade SaaS platform that acts as your **AI Co-Founder**. You describe an idea in a sentence — FoundrIQ transforms it into a **complete, investor-ready startup blueprint** in under 60 seconds, complete with market research, competitor analysis, SWOT, business model, financials, branding, launch roadmap, and an exportable **investor-grade PDF report**.

It combines a fine-tuned prompting layer over **Google Gemini 3.5** with a polished, responsive SaaS interface (auth, workspace chat, reports, history, profile, PDF export, light/dark themes).

---

## 🎯 The Problem & Who It's For

**The Problem.** Every year, millions of aspiring founders, students, and hackathon teams sit on a great idea and stall — because building the first real artifact (a coherent business plan, market map, financial model, and pitch narrative) takes **weeks of scattered research**, expensive consultants, or generic templates that all read the same. Founders don't need more blank Notion docs — they need a **thinking partner** that turns a spark into a structured, defensible plan.

**FoundrIQ solves this** by acting as a senior venture strategist on demand. It grounds every output in your **budget, country, experience, and timeline** — so recommendations are realistic, not boilerplate — and it packages the result into a downloadable investor PDF you can pitch on day one.

**Who it's for:**

- 🎓 **Students & university teams** preparing capstone projects, business-school assignments, or startup competitions.
- 🧑‍💻 **Solo founders & indie hackers** validating ideas before quitting the day job.
- 🏆 **Hackathon teams** who need a full pitch deck's worth of thinking overnight.
- 💼 **Product managers & intrapreneurs** exploring new business lines internally.
- 🎨 **Non-technical creators** who have the vision but not the MBA vocabulary.

## 🤖 The AI Feature

FoundrIQ's core intelligence is a **prompt-engineered venture strategist** on top of **Google Gemini 3.5 Flash**, accessed exclusively server-side through TanStack Start server functions — the API key never touches the browser.

There are **two AI surfaces**:

### 1. Blueprint Generation

Given the founder's input (idea, problem, target customers, country, budget, experience, timeline, unfair advantage), the model returns a strictly-typed JSON blueprint with 25+ fields.

**System prompt (verbatim, lives in `src/lib/gemini.server.ts`):**

> *You are a senior venture strategist who has built and funded multiple startups. You produce concrete, investor-ready business blueprints grounded in current market reality.*
>
> *Rules: never use placeholder text, never repeat generic AI boilerplate, always name real competitors and realistic numbers with currency and timeframes, and tailor every section to the founder's country, budget, experience and timeline.*
>
> *Return ONLY minified JSON matching this exact shape: `{ startupName, tagline, elevatorPitch, problemStatement, solution, targetAudience, customerPersona, marketOpportunity, competitorAnalysis, uniqueSellingProposition, swotAnalysis:{strengths,weaknesses,opportunities,threats}, businessModel, revenueModel, pricingSuggestions, estimatedStartupCost, brandingStrategy, brandIdentity, logoConcept, colorPalette, marketingStrategy, launchRoadmap, financialEstimate, risks, growthOpportunities, investorPitchSummary, recommendations, nextSteps }`.*
>
> *Every string field must be 2–5 substantive sentences. Array fields need 3–5 specific items.*

**Generation config:** `temperature: 1.0`, `topP: 0.95`, `maxOutputTokens: 32768`, `responseMimeType: application/json`, plus a per-request uniqueness seed so the same idea produces fresh perspectives on retry.

**Reliability guarantees:**
- 3-attempt retry with exponential backoff on 429/5xx.
- 45s timeout with `AbortController`.
- Custom `repairJson()` closes unterminated strings, arrays, and objects if Gemini truncates — parsing survives imperfect responses.
- Structured error mapping → human-friendly toasts (never leaks raw errors).

### 2. Workspace Chat Co-Founder

An always-on advisor that continues the conversation with full startup context.

**System prompt (verbatim):**

> *You are FoundrIQ's startup consultant: a professional advisor with operator experience in product, go-to-market, fundraising and unit economics. Always answer in the context of the founder's current startup and the ongoing conversation. Be specific and structured: short intro line, then markdown headings or numbered steps, then a concrete next action. Use real numbers, benchmarks and named examples. Never give vague, generic or filler answers, and never invent facts about the founder that were not provided.*

The generated blueprint JSON is injected into the system prompt as authoritative context, and the last 20 turns of chat history are passed as the conversation trail. Temperature `0.7` keeps advice grounded.

**Design decisions:**
- **Local-first persistence** for reports/history/profile (localStorage) → zero backend cost, instant reads, offline-friendly.
- **Server-only Gemini calls** → API key never leaks to the client.
- **Dynamic redirect URLs** built from `window.location.origin` → works in dev, preview, and production without hardcoding.
